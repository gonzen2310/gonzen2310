Hello, there! Iâ€™m Gonzalo, aka Gonchi, a software engineer based in Rochester, NY. I enjoy crafting beautiful high-performing web and mobile apps for fun and for a living. I love to work on projects that solve real- world problems especially related to community building, finance and education.

I just graduated from college and I will be joining Yelp as a full- stack software engineer.  Apart from coding, I am interested in UI/UX design, I like to play soccer, play with my dog and I love boba tea.
